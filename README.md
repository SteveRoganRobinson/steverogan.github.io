## 🚀 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast and ethical hacker with hands on experience across both red and blue team practices. My passion lies in understanding systems deeply exploiting them ethically, defending them strategically, and continuously learning through real world labs and certifications

**Key focus areas:**

- 🔍 Penetration Testing (Active Directory, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement)  
- 🛡️ SOC Analysis (Wireshark, Snort, Sysmon, Phishing Email Investigation)  
- 🧪 Digital Forensics (Autopsy, USB image analysis, Evidence Reporting)  
- 🌐 IoT & Cloud Security (via academic research and coursework)

**Certifications earned:**

- PJPT • CEH v12 • Security+

Currently exploring **Purple Teaming** and adversary simulation to bridge offensive techniques with blue team detection and defense.

# PNPT — Pro Tips to Pass 
**Passed PNPT on my 1st attempt.**  

## Exam Tips (External)
1. Make sure all tools are installed and Kali is ready.  
2. For external pentest: have Burp Suite (Community OK), ffuf, and good wordlists. Burp Pro is preferred but not necessary.  
3. For usernames: don’t rely on username-anarchy. Enumerate! — Enumerate! — Enumerate! Be thorough and patient.  
4. For passwords: use PNPT-specific/curated password lists.  
5. Don’t waste time with noisy brute forcing — it slows servers and the process.  
6. Think outside the box.

## Exam Tips (Internal / AD)
1. Be familiar with all tools taught in the AD course.  
2. Do **not** skip case studies — they are very important.  
3. Go through all the additional stuff taught by Heath in the course videos.  
4. Think outside the box.
